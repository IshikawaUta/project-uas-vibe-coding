OFA follows a strict **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

-   **Models**: Powered by **Sequel** for SQL and **Mongo Ruby Driver** for NoSQL.
-   **Views**: High-performance **ERB** templates with a modular design system.
-   **Controllers**: Lightweight logic handlers with built-in validation helpers.
-   **Middleware**: Custom authentication and session sliding expiration (8-hour default).

## 🚢 Deployment Guide

One-For-All is designed to be cloud-native and "deploy-ready" from day one.

### 🚂 Railway (Recommended)
Railway is the easiest way to get your OFA app live. The framework includes a `Procfile` that Railway detects automatically.
1. Install [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/guides/cli).
2. Run `railway login`.
3. In your project folder, run:
   ```bash
   ./ofa deploy
   ```
   *The CLI will automatically trigger `railway up` and handle the build process.*

### 🐳 Docker
For customized hosting or VPS providers, use the optimized `Dockerfile`.
1. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-ofa-app .
   ```
2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env my-ofa-app
   ```
   *Note: Ensure your `.env` contains production-ready database credentials.*

### 🖥️ VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS)
To run OFA on a raw Linux server:
1. **Setup**: Clone your repo and run `bundle install --deployment`.
2. **Database**: Run `./ofa db migrate` to sync your production schema.
3. **Process Management**: Use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep the server alive:
   ```bash
   pm2 start "./ofa run" --name ofa-app
   ```
4. **Reverse Proxy**: We recommend using **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to handle SSL and port 80/443 forwarding to port 3000.
